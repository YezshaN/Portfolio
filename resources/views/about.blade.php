        <h1>This is Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Yezsha Narvaez, a passionate web development student dedicated to mastering the art of creating engaging web applications. Throughout this semester, I have immersed myself in various activities focused on building websites using Laravel, which have allowed me to refine my skills and deepen my understanding of web technologies. Each project has been a valuable learning experience, helping me embrace the challenges and joys of web development.</p>
        <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading, spending time with my pets, and watching series or movies. These activities not only provide me with relaxation but also inspire my creativity and approach to web design. I believe that a well-rounded life contributes to my growth as a developer, and I look forward to applying my experiences in future projects.</p>
